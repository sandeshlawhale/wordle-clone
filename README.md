## How I Created This
I,m giving special thanx to `The Net Ninja` I've followed his react tutorial about Wordle clone.
Not all but the most of it is from his tutorial. I was learning the react and this was the best decision to learn with Wordle. A fun way and enjoyable.
I,ve made some improvements from the original tutorial like,
  1. The Keyboard
  2. Input from Keyboard
  3. Other Pages
  4. and more..


Through the journey I've learned a lot. what i learned so far is in front of you try it and share me your response. I'll be happy.
