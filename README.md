- Receive feedback after each guess to guide your next attempt.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Run the application with `npm start`.
5. Also run the json server with `npx json-server --watch ./data/db.json --port 3001`

Also use the different port in json server than localhost.

## How I Created This
I,m giving special thanx to `The Net Ninja` I've followed his react tutorial about Wordle clone.
Not all but the most of it is from his tutorial. I was learning the react and this was the best decision to learn with Wordle. A fun way and enjoyable.
I,ve made some improvements from the original tutorial like,
  1. The Keyboard
  2. Input from Keyboard
  3. Other Pages
  4. and more..

It has some flaws also,
  1. It's not all responsive.
  2. Layout is bit off.
  3. Colors and Typography.

I'll do it in future when i get time fom other projects and all. 

Through the journey I've learned a lot. what i learned so far is in front of you try it and share me your response. I'll be happy.
